# SimpleFS

SimpleFS is a file system which can do basic operations on files.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

This file system is **experimental and under development**.
It is intended for **educational and testing purposes only**.

‚ùó Do **not** use it on physical drives or in any production environment.
If you choose to use it on real hardware, **you do so at your own risk**.

## üì¶ Project Status

This project is in a **very early development stage**.
Currently, it supports only basic operations:

- creating disk image with shell command `create <path> <size in MB>`
- format disk with shell command `format <path>`
- mounting disk with shell command `mount <diskpath> <mountname>`
- select mounted disk with shell command `select [disk]`
- create new file with shell command `mkfile <path> [content]`

To run SimpleFS shell, just run `simplefs` in `build/` directory

Please note that the file system is not fully functional yet and is intended **for testing and experimentation purposes only**.
