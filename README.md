# SimpleFS

SimpleFS is a file system which can do basic operations on files.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING

This file system is **experimental and under development**.  
It is intended for **educational and testing purposes only**.  

‚ùó Do **not** use it on physical drives or in any production environment.  
If you choose to use it on real hardware, **you do so at your own risk**.

## üì¶ Project Status

This project is in a **very early development stage**.  
Currently, it supports only basic operations:

- Creating an empty disk image using the `create` tool
- Creating a partition on an existing image using the `main` executable

Both tools are located in the `build/` directory.

Please note that the file system is not fully functional yet and is intended **for testing and experimentation purposes only**.
